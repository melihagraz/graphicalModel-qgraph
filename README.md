# graphicalModel-qgraph

This code contains  60-100 dimensional genetic real dataset (BDgraph package). 
it finds the interaction of this dataset
then draw the map of network.

In the second code (huge-qgraph), we create a 50 dimensional network from multivariate normal dataset, then construct the structure of the network via qgraph as represented below.
